            <ul>
                <li>disqualify your Submission(s); or</li>

            <p id="parrafoCompetition">A tie between two or more valid and identically ranked submissions will be

            <p id="parrafoCompetition">A Participant may decline to be nominated as a Winner by notifying Kaggle

                stated Honor Code is deemed cheating and, if discovered or reasonably suspected, will result in
                disqualification from the Competition and any other affected Competitions and may result in banning of
                affected Kaggle accounts.</p>
            <h3>RECEIVING PRIZES</h3>
